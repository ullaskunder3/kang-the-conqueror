CSS the flexBox

Flexbox, or the Flexible Box Layout, is a powerful CSS layout module that gives web designers and developers an efficient and simple way to lay out, align and distribute elements in a container.

flexbox is made up of two elements: a flex container (or flex parent) and flex items (flex children). A flex container is a containing element (like a div) given the display property flex. Flex items are child elements of a flex container, which can be manipulated through various display properties.
